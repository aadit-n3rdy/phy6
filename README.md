# Phy6

A small project to simulate electric charges and electric fields constrained on a 2D plane

## Introduction

This project is intended to get a more intuitive grasp of electrostatics, especially
the concepts that would be covered in a undergrad course on computer science. No
complicated algorithms have been used, the project works completely based on
calculating forces and displacements over very small timesteps.
